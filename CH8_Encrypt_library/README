The header files can be placed in /usr/include or /usr/local/include
Or they can be placed in a dedicated directory, e.g. /my_header_files. 
In that case there needs to be entry in the IDE under Properties-> C/C++ Build -> Settings
-> GCC Compiler -> Includes
...
You can add the .o files into a library and store them seperately.
To add files to a library use:

ar -rcs libhfsecurity.a encrypt.o checksum.o

ar: archive command
r: update if file exists
c: create without feedback
s: create index at start of the archive

Use nm to view the archive

nm libc.a
or
ar -t <filename>

To extract an object file use:

ar -x libhfsecurity.a encrypt.o

When done, add the library to the context of the project; use: 
Properties-> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> GCC C Linker -> Libaries -> "name the library and
its search path"
E.g.: library (-l) "hfsecurity" at Library search path (-L) path: /my_library_files;

Note: the file is actually called: "libhfsecurity.a" !!

If you place the .h and the .a files in the standard directories that GCC is looking in,
you don't have to specify additional places to search.

for include .h files the standard directores are:
/usr/include or /usr/local/include

for library or .a files the standard directories are:
/usr/lib or /usr/local/lib

When compiling with a static library, an executable file is produced that has all
code necessary to run.

A dynamic library is linked at runtime with the application by the OS.
